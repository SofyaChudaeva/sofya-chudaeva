    <h2>AI and Career Empowerment</h2>
    <p> <a href="aicourse.pdf" target="_blank">My Certificate (PDF)   </a> <br>
      This 10-week course covered the following topics: AI literacy, capabilities, and systems, the marketing revolution, AI’s impacts on organizations and supply chains, responsible AI, AI in financial services. It also covered several career empowerment topics such as: “being your own startup”, negotiation from a position of weakness, and job search in the age of AI. My favourite part of the course was the interviews with Bayan Bruss, the Vice President of Applied AI Research at Capital One, EY Partners Amy Jones and Mike Dobslaw, among other industry professionals.<br> 
 	One of the main points of emphasis in this course that resonated with me is the message that we should worry less about AI “taking our jobs”, and focus more on keeping up with the constantly-evolving world of technology and be prepared to use it to our advantage. A discussion with Mike Dobslaw, called “AI and Human Jobs - Threat or Opportunity” revealed the most relevant skills for chain managers in the future to be: agility, willingness to understand technology, and leverage it to make their job faster, easier, and more effective. <br>
	Overall, this course has given me a well-rounded perspective of the ways that AI affects many different industries, and it leaves me with the lingering question: “Considering how much the use of AI has grown lately, I am curious if enough effort is being put into developing a sustainable source for the large amounts of energy being used to run sophisticated AI systems worldwide?” <br>

   <h2>EY - Forensic and Integrity Services Job Simulation</h2>
    <p> In this job simulation, I analyzed discrepancies in the wealth of an employee under investigation. Also, I examined a sample Purchase Order, Invoice, Credit Note, and Fixed Asset Register, and identified potential risks and issues.

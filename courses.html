    <h2>AI and Career Empowerment</h2>
    <p> <a href="aicourse.pdf" target="_blank">My Certificate (PDF)   </a> <br>
      This 10-week course covered the following topics: AI literacy, capabilities, and systems, the marketing revolution, AI’s impacts on organizations and supply chains, responsible AI, AI in financial services. It also covered several career empowerment topics such as: “being your own startup”, negotiation from a position of weakness, and job search in the age of AI. My favourite part of the course was the interviews with Bayan Bruss, the Vice President of Applied AI Research at Capital One, EY Partners Amy Jones and Mike Dobslaw, among other industry professionals.<br> 
 	One of the main points of emphasis in this course that resonated with me is the message that we should worry less about AI “taking our jobs”, and focus more on keeping up with the constantly-evolving world of technology and be prepared to use it to our advantage. A discussion with Mike Dobslaw, called “AI and Human Jobs - Threat or Opportunity” revealed the most relevant skills for chain managers in the future to be: agility, willingness to understand technology, and leverage it to make their job faster, easier, and more effective. <br>
	Overall, this course has given me a well-rounded perspective of the ways that AI affects many different industries, and it leaves me with the lingering question: “Considering how much the use of AI has grown lately, I am curious if enough effort is being put into developing a sustainable source for the large amounts of energy being used to run sophisticated AI systems worldwide?” <br>

   <h2>EY - Forensic and Integrity Services Job Simulation (on Forage)</h2>
    <p> In this job simulation, I analyzed discrepancies in the wealth of an employee under investigation. Also, I examined a sample Purchase Order, Invoice, Credit Note, and Fixed Asset Register, and identified potential risks and issues.

   <h2>KPMG in Canada Experience a Day with KPMG Tax Job Simulation (on Forage)</h2>
    <p>I completed this job simulation, which gave me insight into a typical day for a KPMG tax specialist. I applied my proficiency in Excel and data manipulation skills to create a revenue leadsheet from a trial balance and leveraged PowerBI’s trend analysis to pinpoint and investigate anomalous revenue patterns, aiding data-driven decision-making. Overall, I enhanced my skills in conveying audit findings and recommendations to Senior Managers and developed the ability to identify and communicate concerns regarding revenue control design during audit engagements, fostering proactive risk management.

    <h2>KPMG in Canada Experience a Day with KPMG Audit & Assurance Job Simulation (on Forage)</h2>
    <p>I completed this job simulation focused on CPA Career Launch with KPMG and practiced conveying audit findings to Senior Managers, honing my skills in presenting recommendations and insights. Also, I applied Excel functions to create a revenue leadsheet, and leveraged PowerBI’s trend analysis capabilities to identify and investigate unusual revenue trends and drafted emails to Senior Accountants highlighting concerns in the design and implementation of revenue controls during audit engagements.

    <h2>Fundamentals of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence - Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h2>
    <p>In this course, I learned about the machine learning process, which starts from training data. This data can be labeled and unlabeled, as well as structured and unstructured. An example of labeled data is pictures of animals with their respective labels, and unlabeled data would be just the pictures of animals. Structured data refers to data that is organized: either tabular data or time-series data. Unstructured data is more difficult for machine learning to process, and includes formats such as text and image data. Next, this data is fed into machine learning(ML) algorithms, which can be: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning entails using labeled data to train an algorithm to predict the outcomes for new data. Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data and discovers inherent patters, structures, or relationships within the input data. Reinforcement learning involved the machine getting only a performance score as guidance for its analysis of data that is both labeled and unlabeled. This type of ML relies on rewards and penalties for its actions and results. Now that the model is trained, we can begin inferencing, which can be either batch inferencing or real-time inferencing. The difference between those types of inferencing is that batch inferencing emphasizes efficiency and accuracy over speed, and real-time inferencing requires the model to make quick decisions in response to new information as it is fed to the model. <br>
    Next, deep learning. This subdomain of ML is inspired by the structure of the human brain and aims to mimic the way human brains process information and make decisions. These neural networks learns patter recognition and then applies it to entirely new data. This fiels of ML is what makes natural language processing (NLP) possible. NLP deals with the interaction between humans and computers, and computers' ability to understand human language. <br>
  Generative AI is powered by foundation models (FM), which are pretrained on internet-scale data and can be adapted to perform multiple tasks with a singular model. The FM lifecycle is as follows: data selection(labeled & unlabeled), pre-training(often through self-supervised learning!), optimization(prompt engineering, etc), evaluation, deployment, and feedback and continuous improvement. <br>
The next major topic of discussion are large language models (LLMs). LLMs use tokens(basic units of text) and embeddings and vectors (numerical representations of tokens) to understand and generate text. Some other interesting models used in ML include generative adversarial networks(GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). GANs consist of a generator which produces new synthetic data from random noise and makes it resemble the training data, and the discriminator, which takes both real training data and synthetic data generated by the generator and attempts to distinguish between the two. VAEs consist of an encoder and a decoder - two neural networks. The encoder takes input data and maps it to a lower-dimensional latent space, and then the decoder takes this representation and reconstructs the original input data.  </p>
